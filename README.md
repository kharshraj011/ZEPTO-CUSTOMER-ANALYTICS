# ZEPTO-CUSTOMER-ANALYTICS

## About the Project
This project is about understanding customer behavior for a Zepto-like business.
I analyzed how often customers return, how many stop purchasing, and which customers bring more value.

## What I Analyzed
- Customer retention
- Churn rate
- Repeat purchases
- Monthly cohort analysis
- Customer lifetime value (CLV)

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX

## Key Learnings
- Not all customers return after their first order
- Repeat customers contribute more to revenue
- Some customer groups have better long-term retention

## Files
- Power BI dashboard (.pbix)
- Dataset and screenshots
